<br><hr>

### notes on drawing mazes
the program only detects black and shades of grey, and may be innacurate if lines are drawn too thin <br><br>
using own maze:
- draw with thick black lines (like in the 'maze example' image provided) on an 800px square canvas
- place image in the 'Image' folder
- example mazes provided

The program will select the first image in the folder, make sure the one you want to scan is the only one in there <br>

<br><hr>
to improve accuracy:
- increase rows
- increase pixel scan leniency <br>
